# Services

This directory contains service modules that implement the business logic for the FreelancePro SL platform.

## Overview

Each service module provides a set of related functionalities and encapsulates the business logic, separating it from the route handlers. This approach ensures cleaner, more maintainable code and allows for easier testing.

## Service Modules

- **auth_service.py**: Handles user authentication, registration, password reset, and email verification.
- **search_service.py**: Implements search functionality for freelancers, jobs, and clients.
- **payment_service.py**: Manages payment transactions, including mobile money integration.
- **notification_service.py**: Handles notifications and email communications.

## Usage

Service modules are imported and used by the route handlers to process requests and return responses. For example:

```python
from services.auth_service import AuthService

# In a route handler
result = AuthService.login_user(email, password)
```

## Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service focuses on a specific domain of functionality.
- **Stateless**: Services don't maintain state between calls; any state is stored in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Services handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages.
- **Transaction Management**: Database operations use proper transaction management to ensure data integrity.
